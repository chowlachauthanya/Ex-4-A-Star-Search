<H3>Algorithm:</H3>


// A* Search Algorithm
1.  Initialize the open list
2.  Initialize the closed list
    put the starting node on the open 
    list (you can leave its f at zero)

3.  while the open list is not empty
    a) find the node with the least f on 
       the open list, call it "q"

    b) pop q off the open list
  
    c) generate q's 8 successors and set their 
       parents to q
   
    d) for each successor
        i) if successor is the goal, stop search
        
        ii) else, compute both g and h for successor
          successor.g = q.g + distance between 
                              successor and q
          successor.h = distance from goal to 
          successor (This can be done using many 
          ways, we will discuss three heuristics- 
          Manhattan, Diagonal and Euclidean 
          Heuristics)
          
          successor.f = successor.g + successor.h

        iii) if a node with the same position as 
            successor is in the OPEN list which has a 
           lower f than successor, skip this successor

        iV) if a node with the same position as 
            successor  is in the CLOSED list which has
            a lower f than successor, skip this successor
            otherwise, add  the node to the open list
     end (for loop)
  
    e) push q on the closed list
    end (while loop)

## PROGRAM
```python
def a_star(start, goal, graph, h):
    open_list = [start]
    g = {start: 0}
    parent = {start: None}

    while open_list:
        n = min(open_list, key=lambda x: g[x] + h[x])
        if n == goal:
            path = []
            while n:
                path.append(n)
                n = parent[n]
            return path[::-1]

        open_list.remove(n)
        for m, cost in graph.get(n, []):
            if m not in g or g[m] > g[n] + cost:
                g[m] = g[n] + cost
                parent[m] = n
                if m not in open_list:
                    open_list.append(m)
    return None

#User Input for graph
graph = {}
h = {}

nodes = input("Enter all nodes separated by space: ").split()

for node in nodes:
    h[node] = int(input(f"Heuristic value for {node}: "))
    graph[node] = []
    n = int(input(f"How many neighbors does {node} have? "))
    for _ in range(n):
        neighbor = input("  Enter neighbor node: ")
        cost = int(input(f"  Enter cost to reach {neighbor}: "))
        graph[node].append((neighbor, cost))

start = input("Enter start node: ")
goal = input("Enter goal node: ")

path = a_star(start, goal, graph, h)
print("Path found:", path)
```
